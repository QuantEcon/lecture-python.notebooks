    "The optimal value for the dual problem is 141018.24, which equals the value of the primal problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s interpret the dual variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "By strong duality and also our  numerical results, we have that  optimal value is:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "100,000 p_1 - 20,000 p_4 - 20,000 p_5 - 20,000 p_6 + 50,000 p_7.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We know if $ b_i $ changes one dollor, then the optimal payoff in the end of the third year will change $ p_i $ dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "For $ i = 1 $, this means if the initial capital changes by one dollar, then the optimal payoff in the end of the third year will change $ p_1 $ dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, $ p_1 $ is the potential value of one more unit of initial capital, or the shadow price for initial capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also interpret $ p_1 $ as the prospective  value in the end of the third year coming from having  one more  dollar to invest at the beginning of the first year.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the mutual fund can raise money at a cost lower than $ p_1 - 1 $, then it should raise more money to increase its revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if it bears a cost of funds higher than $ p_1 - 1 $, the mutual fund shouldn’t do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "For $ i = 4, 5, 6 $, this means that if the amount of capital that the fund is permitted to borrow from the bank changes by one dollar, the optimal pay out  at the end of the third year will change $ p_i $ dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, for $ i = 4, 5, 6 $, $ |p_i| $ indicates the value of one dollar that the mutual fund can borrow from the bank at the beginning of the $ i-3 $-th year.\n",

    "$ |p_i| $ is the shadow price for the loan amount. (We use absolute value here since $ p_i \\le 0 $.)\n",

    "If the interest rate is lower than $ |p_i| $, then the mutual fund should borrow to increase its optimal payoff;  if the interest rate is higher, it is better to not do this.\n",

    "For $ i = 7 $, this means that if the amount of the corporate bond the mutual fund can buy changes one dollar, then the optimal payoff will change $ p_7 $ dollars at the end of the third year.  Again, $ p_7 $ is the shadow price for the amount of the corporate bond the mutual fund can buy.\n",

    "1. $ p_4 = p_5 = 0 $, which means the loan amounts at the beginning of the first and second year are worth nothing. Recall that the optimal solution to the primal problem, $ x_2, x_3 > 0 $, which means at the beginning of the first and second year, the mutual fund has a postive bank account and borrows no capital from the bank. Thus, it is reasonable that the loan amounts at the beginning of the first and second year are valueless. This is what the  complementary slackness conditions mean in this setting.  \n",
    "1. $ p_6 = -0.16 $, which means one dollar of the loan amount at the beginning of the third year is worth $ \\\\$ 0.16 $. Since $ |p_6| $ is higher than the interest rate 6%, the mutual fund should borrow as much as possible at the beginning of the third year. Recall that  the optimal solution to the primal problem is  $ x_4 = -20,000 $ which means the mutual fund borrows money from the bank as much as it can.  \n",
    "1. $ p_7 = 0.0015 $, which means one dollar of the amount of the corporate bond that the mutual fund can buy is worth $ \\\\$ 0.0015 $.  "
