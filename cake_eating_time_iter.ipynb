    "In this lecture, we introduce the core idea of **time iteration**: iterating on\n",
    "a guess of the optimal policy using the Euler equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach differs from the value function iteration we used in\n",
    "[Cake Eating III: Stochastic Dynamics](https://python.quantecon.org/cake_eating_stochastic.html), where we iterated on the value function itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time iteration exploits the structure of the Euler equation to find the optimal\n",
    "policy directly, rather than computing the value function as an intermediate step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key advantage is computational efficiency: by working directly with the\n",
    "policy function, we can often solve problems faster than with value function iteration.\n",

    "problem.\n",
