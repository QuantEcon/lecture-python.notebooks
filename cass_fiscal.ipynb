    "## Overview\n",

    "This lecture studies effects of foreseen   fiscal and technology shocks on competitive equilibrium prices and quantities in a nonstochastic version of a Cass-Koopmans  growth model with features described in this QuantEcon lecture [Cass-Koopmans Competitive Equilibrium](https://python.quantecon.org/cass_koopmans_2.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "We use the model as a laboratory to experiment with  numerical techniques for approximating equilibria and to display the structure of dynamic models in which decision makers have perfect foresight about future government decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following a classic paper by Robert E. Hall [[Hall, 1971](https://python.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id275)], we augment a nonstochastic version of the Cass-Koopmans optimal  growth model with a government that purchases a stream of goods and that finances its purchases  with an sequences of several  distorting flat-rate taxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distorting taxes prevent a competitive equilibrium allocation from solving a planning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, to compute an equilibrium allocation and price system, we solve a system of nonlinear difference equations consisting of the first-order conditions for decision makers and the other equilibrium conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We present two ways to approximate an equilibrium:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first is a shooting algorithm like the one that we deployed  in [Cass-Koopmans Competitive Equilibrium](https://python.quantecon.org/cass_koopmans_2.html).  \n",
    "- The second method is a root-finding algorithm that  minimizes residuals from the  first-order conditions of the consumer and   representative firm.  \n",
