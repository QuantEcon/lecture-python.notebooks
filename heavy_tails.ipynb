    "draws tend not to deviate too much from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having internalized these kinds of distributions, many researchers and\n",
    "practitioners use rules of thumb such as “outcomes more than four or five\n",
    "standard deviations from the mean can safely be ignored.”\n",

    "However, some distributions encountered in economics have far more probability\n",
    "mass in the tails than distributions like the normal distribution.\n",
