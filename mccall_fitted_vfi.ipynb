    "In this lecture we again study the [McCall job search model with separation](https://python.quantecon.org/mccall_model_with_separation.html), but now with a continuous wage distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we already considered continuous wage distributions briefly in the\n",
    "exercises of the [first job search lecture](https://python.quantecon.org/mccall_model.html),\n",
    "the change was relatively trivial in that case.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because we were able to reduce the problem to solving for a single\n",
    "scalar value (the continuation value).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, with separation, the change is less trivial, since a continuous wage distribution leads to an uncountably infinite state space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The infinite state space leads to additional challenges, particularly when it\n",
    "comes to applying value function iteration (VFI).\n",
    "\n",
    "These challenges will lead us to modify VFI by adding an interpolation step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of VFI and this interpolation step is called **fitted value function iteration** (fitted VFI).\n",
    "\n",
    "Fitted VFI is very common in practice, so we will take some time to work through the details.\n",
