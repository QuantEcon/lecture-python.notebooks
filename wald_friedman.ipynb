    "\n",

    "\n",
    "To quote Abraham Wald,\n",
    "\n",
    "> A test procedure leading to the acceptance or rejection of the [null]\n",
    "hypothesis in question is simply a rule specifying, for each possible\n",
    "sample of size $ n $, whether the [null] hypothesis should be accepted\n",
    "or rejected on the basis of the sample. This may also be expressed as\n",
    "follows: A test procedure is simply a subdivision of the totality of\n",
    "all possible samples of size $ n $ into two mutually exclusive\n",
    "parts, say part 1 and part 2, together with the application of the\n",
    "rule that the [null] hypothesis be accepted if the observed sample is\n",
    "contained in part 2. Part 1 is also called the critical region. Since\n",
    "part 2 is the totality of all samples of size $ n $ which are not\n",
    "included in part 1, part 2 is uniquely determined by part 1. Thus,\n",
    "choosing a test procedure is equivalent to determining a critical\n",
    "region.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s listen to Wald longer:\n",
    "\n",
    "> As a basis for choosing among critical regions the following\n",
    "considerations have been advanced by Neyman and Pearson: In accepting\n",
    "or rejecting $ H_0 $ we may commit errors of two kinds. We commit\n",
    "an error of the first kind if we reject $ H_0 $ when it is true;\n",
    "we commit an error of the second kind if we accept $ H_0 $ when\n",
    "$ H_1 $ is true. After a particular critical region $ W $ has\n",
    "been chosen, the probability of committing an error of the first\n",
    "kind, as well as the probability of committing an error of the second\n",
    "kind is uniquely determined. The probability of committing an error\n",
    "of the first kind is equal to the probability, determined by the\n",
    "assumption that $ H_0 $ is true, that the observed sample will be\n",
    "included in the critical region $ W $. The probability of\n",
    "committing an error of the second kind is equal to the probability,\n",
    "determined on the assumption that $ H_1 $ is true, that the\n",
    "probability will fall outside the critical region $ W $. For any\n",
    "given critical region $ W $ we shall denote the probability of an\n",
    "error of the first kind by $ \\alpha $ and the probability of an\n",
    "error of the second kind by $ \\beta $.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s listen carefully to how Wald applies law of large numbers to\n",
    "interpret $ \\alpha $ and $ \\beta $:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The probabilities $ \\alpha $ and $ \\beta $ have the\n",
    "following important practical interpretation: Suppose that we draw a\n",
    "large number of samples of size $ n $. Let $ M $ be the\n",
    "number of such samples drawn. Suppose that for each of these\n",
    "$ M $ samples we reject $ H_0 $ if the sample is included in\n",
    "$ W $ and accept $ H_0 $ if the sample lies outside\n",
    "$ W $. In this way we make $ M $ statements of rejection or\n",
    "acceptance. Some of these statements will in general be wrong. If\n",
    "$ H_0 $ is true and if $ M $ is large, the probability is\n",
    "nearly $ 1 $ (i.e., it is practically certain) that the\n",
    "proportion of wrong statements (i.e., the number of wrong statements\n",
    "divided by $ M $) will be approximately $ \\alpha $. If\n",
    "$ H_1 $ is true, the probability is nearly $ 1 $ that the\n",
    "proportion of wrong statements will be approximately $ \\beta $.\n",
    "Thus, we can say that in the long run [ here Wald applies law of\n",
    "large numbers by driving $ M \\rightarrow \\infty $ (our comment,\n",
    "not Wald’s) ] the proportion of wrong statements will be\n",

    "Wald notes that\n",

    "- In [this sequel](https://python.quantecon.org/wald_friedman_2.html), we reformulate the problem from the perspective of a **Bayesian statistician** who views parameters as vectors of random variables that are jointly distributed with the observables they are concerned about.  \n",
    "- The concept of **exchangeability**, which underlies much of statistical learning, is explored in depth in our [lecture on exchangeable random variables](https://python.quantecon.org/exchangeable.html).  \n",
    "- For a deeper understanding of likelihood ratio processes and their role in frequentist and Bayesian statistical theories, see [Likelihood Ratio Processes](https://python.quantecon.org/likelihood_ratio_process.html).  \n",
    "- Building on that foundation, [Likelihood Ratio Processes and Bayesian Learning](https://python.quantecon.org/likelihood_bayes.html) examines the role of likelihood ratio processes in **Bayesian learning**.  \n",
    "- Finally, [this later lecture](https://python.quantecon.org/navy_captain.html) revisits the subject discussed here and examines whether the frequentist decision rule that the Navy ordered the captain to use would perform better or worse than Abraham Wald’s sequential decision rule.  "
