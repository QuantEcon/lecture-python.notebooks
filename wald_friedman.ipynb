    "On pages 137-139 of his 1998 book *Two Lucky People* with Rose Friedman [[FF98](https://python.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id64)],\n",

    "during World War II, when they worked at the US Government’s\n",
    "Statistical Research Group at Columbia University.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s listen to Milton Friedman tell us what happened\n",
    "\n",
    "> In order to understand the story, it is necessary to have an idea of a\n",
    "simple statistical problem, and of the standard procedure for dealing\n",
    "with it. The actual problem out of which sequential analysis grew will\n",
    "serve. The Navy has two alternative designs (say A and B) for a\n",
    "projectile. It wants to determine which is superior. To do so it\n",
    "undertakes a series of paired firings. On each round, it assigns the\n",
    "value 1 or 0 to A accordingly as its performance is superior or inferior\n",
    "to that of B and conversely 0 or 1 to B. The Navy asks the statistician\n",
    "how to conduct the test and how to analyze the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> The standard statistical answer was to specify a number of firings (say\n",
    "1,000) and a pair of percentages (e.g., 53% and 47%) and tell the client\n",
    "that if A receives a 1 in more than 53% of the firings, it can be\n",
    "regarded as superior; if it receives a 1 in fewer than 47%, B can be\n",
    "regarded as superior; if the percentage is between 47% and 53%, neither\n",
    "can be so regarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> When Allen Wallis was discussing such a problem with (Navy) Captain\n",
    "Garret L. Schyler, the captain objected that such a test, to quote from\n",
    "Allen’s account, may prove wasteful. If a wise and seasoned ordnance\n",
    "officer like Schyler were on the premises, he would see after the first\n",
    "few thousand or even few hundred [rounds] that the experiment need not\n",
    "be completed either because the new method is obviously inferior or\n",
    "because it is obviously superior beyond what was hoped for\n",
    "$ \\ldots $.\n",
    "\n",

    "Friedman and Wallis struggled with the problem but, after realizing that\n",
    "they were not able to solve it,  described the problem to  Abraham Wald.\n",

    "or rejecting $ H_0 $ we may commit errors of two kinds. We commit\n",
    "an error of the first kind if we reject $ H_0 $ when it is true;\n",
    "we commit an error of the second kind if we accept $ H_0 $ when\n",

    "been chosen, the probability of committing an error of the first\n",
    "kind, as well as the probability of committing an error of the second\n",
    "kind is uniquely determined. The probability of committing an error\n",
    "of the first kind is equal to the probability, determined by the\n",
    "assumption that $ H_0 $ is true, that the observed sample will be\n",
    "included in the critical region $ W $. The probability of\n",
    "committing an error of the second kind is equal to the probability,\n",
    "determined on the assumption that $ H_1 $ is true, that the\n",
    "probability will fall outside the critical region $ W $. For any\n",
    "given critical region $ W $ we shall denote the probability of an\n",
    "error of the first kind by $ \\alpha $ and the probability of an\n",
    "error of the second kind by $ \\beta $.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s listen carefully to how Wald applies law of large numbers to\n",
    "interpret $ \\alpha $ and $ \\beta $:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The probabilities $ \\alpha $ and $ \\beta $ have the\n",
    "following important practical interpretation: Suppose that we draw a\n",
    "large number of samples of size $ n $. Let $ M $ be the\n",
    "number of such samples drawn. Suppose that for each of these\n",
    "$ M $ samples we reject $ H_0 $ if the sample is included in\n",
    "$ W $ and accept $ H_0 $ if the sample lies outside\n",
    "$ W $. In this way we make $ M $ statements of rejection or\n",
    "acceptance. Some of these statements will in general be wrong. If\n",
    "$ H_0 $ is true and if $ M $ is large, the probability is\n",
    "nearly $ 1 $ (i.e., it is practically certain) that the\n",
    "proportion of wrong statements (i.e., the number of wrong statements\n",
    "divided by $ M $) will be approximately $ \\alpha $. If\n",
    "$ H_1 $ is true, the probability is nearly $ 1 $ that the\n",
    "proportion of wrong statements will be approximately $ \\beta $.\n",
    "Thus, we can say that in the long run [ here Wald applies law of\n",
    "large numbers by driving $ M \\rightarrow \\infty $ (our comment,\n",
    "not Wald’s) ] the proportion of wrong statements will be\n",
    "$ \\alpha $ if $ H_0 $is true and $ \\beta $ if\n",
    "$ H_1 $ is true.\n",

    "\n",
    "The quantity $ \\alpha $ is called the *size* of the critical region,\n",
    "and the quantity $ 1-\\beta $ is called the *power* of the critical\n",

    "\n",
    "Wald notes that\n",

    "> A rule is given for making one of the following three decisions at any stage of\n",

    "a test procedure is carried out sequentially. On the basis of the first\n",
    "observation, one of the aforementioned decision is made. If the first or\n",
    "second decision is made, the process is terminated. If the third\n",
    "decision is made, a second trial is performed. Again, on the basis of\n",
    "the first two observations, one of the three decision is made. If the\n",
    "third decision is made, a third trial is performed, and so on. The\n",
    "process is continued until either the first or the second decisions is\n",
    "made. The number n of observations required by such a test procedure is\n",
