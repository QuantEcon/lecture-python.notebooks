    "This lecture describes how Morris [[1996](https://python.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id144)] extended the Harrison–Kreps model [[Harrison and Kreps, 1978](https://python.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id143)] of speculative asset pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like Harrison and Kreps’s model, Morris’s model determines the price of a dividend-yielding asset that is traded by risk-neutral investors who have heterogeneous beliefs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Harrison-Kreps model assumes that the traders have dogmatic, hard-wired beliefs about the asset’s dividend stream.\n",

    ">Morris’s traders don’t use data on past prices of the asset to update their beliefs about the\n",
    "dividend process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of the environment in Morris’s model include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All traders share a set  of statistical models for prospective dividends  \n",
    "- A single parameter indexes the set of statistical models  \n",
    "- All traders observe the same dividend history  \n",
    "- All traders use Bayes’ Law to update beliefs  \n",
    "- Traders have different initial *prior distributions* over the parameter  \n",
    "- Traders’  *posterior distributions* over the parameter eventually merge  \n",
    "- Before their posterior distributions merge,  traders disagree about the  predictive density over prospective dividends  \n",
    "  - therefore they disagree  about the value of the asset  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as in the hard-wired beliefs model of Harrison and Kreps, those differences of opinion induce  investors to  engage in *speculative behavior* in the following sense:\n",
    "\n",
    "- sometimes they are willing to pay more for the asset than what they think is its “fundamental” value, i.e., the expected discounted value of its prospective dividend stream  \n",
