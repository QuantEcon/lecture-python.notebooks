    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a sequel to [this quantecon lecture](https://python.quantecon.org/likelihood_bayes.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "We discuss two ways to create a compound lottery and their consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "A compound lottery can be said to create a *mixture distribution*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our two ways of constructing a compound lottery will differ in their **timing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- in one, mixing between two possible probability distributions  will occur once and all at the beginning of time  \n",
    "- in the other, mixing between the same two possible probability distributions will occur each period  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistical setting is close but not identical to the problem studied in that quantecon lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that lecture, there were two  i.i.d. processes that could possibly govern successive draws of a non-negative random variable $ W $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nature decided  once and for all whether to make  a sequence of IID draws from either $ f $ or from $ g $.\n",
    "\n",
    "That lecture studied an agent who knew both $ f $ and $ g $ but  did not know which distribution nature chose at time $ -1 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent represented that ignorance  by assuming that nature had chosen  $ f $ or $ g $ by  flipping an unfair coin that put probability  $ \\pi_{-1} $ on probability distribution $ f $.\n",
    "\n",
    "That assumption allowed the agent to construct a subjective joint probability distribution over the\n",
    "random sequence $ \\{W_t\\}_{t=0}^\\infty $.\n",
    "\n",
    "We studied how the agent would then use the laws of conditional probability and an observed history $ w^t =\\{w_s\\}_{s=0}^t $ to form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\pi_t = E [ \\textrm{nature chose distribution}  f | w^t] , \\quad  t = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the  setting of this lecture, that rule imputes to the agent an incorrect model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason is that  now the wage sequence is actually described by a different statistical model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we change the [quantecon lecture](https://python.quantecon.org/likelihood_bayes.html) specification in the following way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, **each period** $ t \\geq 0 $, nature flips a possibly unfair coin that comes up $ f $ with probability $ \\alpha $\n",
    "and $ g $ with probability $ 1 -\\alpha $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, nature perpetually draws from the **mixture distribution** with c.d.f.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H(w) = \\alpha F(w) + (1-\\alpha) G(w), \\quad \\alpha \\in (0,1)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll study two agents  who try to learn about the wage process, but who use different  statistical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both types of agent know $ f $ and $ g $ but neither knows $ \\alpha $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first type of agent erroneously thinks that at time $ -1 $ nature once and for all chose $ f $ or $ g $ and thereafter\n",
    "permanently draws from that distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our second type of agent knows, correctly, that nature mixes $ f $ and $ g $ with mixing probability $ \\alpha \\in (0,1) $\n",
    "each period, though the agent doesn’t know the mixing parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first type of agent applies the learning algorithm described in [this  quantecon lecture](https://python.quantecon.org/likelihood_bayes.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the statistical model that prevailed in that lecture, that was a good learning algorithm and it enabled the Bayesian learner\n",
    "eventually to learn the distribution that nature had drawn at time $ -1 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because the agent’s statistical model was *correct* in the sense of being aligned with the data\n",
    "generating process.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in the present context, our type 1 decision maker’s model is incorrect because the model $ h $ that actually\n",
    "generates the data is neither $ f $ nor $ g $ and so is beyond the support of the models that the agent thinks are\n",
    "possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, we’ll see that our first type of agent muddles through and eventually learns something  interesting and useful, even though it is not *true*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, it turns out that our type 1 agent who is armed with a wrong statistical model ends up learning whichever probability distribution, $ f $ or $ g $,\n",
    "is in a special sense *closest* to the $ h $ that actually generates the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll tell the sense in which it is closest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our second type of agent understands that nature mixes between $ f $ and $ g $ each period with a fixed mixing\n",
    "probability $ \\alpha $.\n",
    "\n",
    "But  the agent doesn’t know $ \\alpha $.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent sets out to learn $ \\alpha $ using Bayes’ law applied to his model.\n",
    "\n",
    "His model is correct in the sense that\n",
    "it includes the actual data generating process $ h $ as a possible distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we’ll learn about\n",
    "\n",
    "- how nature can *mix* between two distributions $ f $ and $ g $ to create a new distribution $ h $.  \n",
    "- The Kullback-Leibler statistical divergence [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback–Leibler_divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) that governs statistical learning under an incorrect statistical model  \n",
    "- A useful Python function `numpy.searchsorted` that,  in conjunction with a uniform random number generator, can be used to sample from an arbitrary distribution  \n",
