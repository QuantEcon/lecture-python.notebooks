    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These papers are related to ideas in the following lectures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The multiplier–accelerator mechanism in [Samuelson Multiplier-Accelerator](https://python.quantecon.org/samuelson.html)  \n",
    "- Linear stochastic difference equations and autocovariances in [Linear State Space Models](https://python.quantecon.org/linear_models.html)  \n",
    "- Eigenmodes of multivariate dynamics in [VARs and DMDs](https://python.quantecon.org/var_dmd.html)  \n",

    "- In stochastic models, a “cycle” shows up as a local peak in a (univariate) spectral density.  \n",
