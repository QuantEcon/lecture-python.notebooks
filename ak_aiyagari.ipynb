    "- A competitive equilibrium with incomplete markets determines prices and quantities  \n",

    "- Agents receive idiosyncratic labor productivity shocks that cannot be fully insured as in  [[Aiyagari, 1994](https://python.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id155)]  \n",
    "- Government fiscal policy instruments include tax rates, debt, and transfers as in chapter 2 of [[Auerbach and Kotlikoff, 1987](https://python.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id274)] and [Transitions in an Overlapping Generations Model](https://python.quantecon.org/ak2.html)  \n",

    "- How fiscal policies affect different generations  \n",
