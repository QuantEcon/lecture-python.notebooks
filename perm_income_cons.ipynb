    "\n",
    "This lecture continues our analysis of the linear-quadratic (LQ) permanent income model of savings and consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in our [previous lecture](https://python.quantecon.org/perm_income.html) on this topic, Robert Hall [[Hal78](https://python.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id122)] used the LQ permanent income model to restrict and interpret intertemporal comovements of nondurable consumption, nonfinancial income, and financial wealth.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we saw how the model asserts that for any covariance stationary process for nonfinancial income\n",
    "\n",
    "- consumption is a random walk  \n",
    "- financial wealth has a unit root and is cointegrated with consumption  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Other applications use the same LQ framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a model isomorphic to the LQ permanent income model has been used by Robert Barro [[Bar79](https://python.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id106)] to interpret intertemporal comovements of a government’s tax collections, its  expenditures net of debt service, and its public debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "This isomorphism means that in analyzing the LQ permanent income model, we are in effect also analyzing  the Barro tax smoothing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is just a matter of appropriately relabeling the variables in Hall’s model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we’ll\n",
    "\n",
    "- show how the solution to the LQ permanent income model can be obtained using LQ control methods.  \n",
    "- represent the model as a linear state space system as in [this lecture](https://python.quantecon.org/linear_models.html).  \n",
    "- apply [QuantEcon](http://quantecon.org/quantecon-py)’s [LinearStateSpace](https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.py/blob/master/quantecon/lss.py) class to characterize statistical features of the consumer’s optimal consumption and borrowing plans.  \n",
