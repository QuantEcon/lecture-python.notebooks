The closer are these probabilities, the higher the variance of the estimator becomes.  \n",

    "\n",
    "The justifications for a randomized response procedure are that\n",
    "\n",
    "- Respondents are thought to feel discomfort from being perceived as belonging to the sensitive group.  \n",
    "- Respondents prefer to answer questions truthfully than to lie, unless it is too revealing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If a privacy measure is not completely consistent with the rational behavior of the respondents, all efforts to derive an optimal model design are futile.\n",
    "\n",
    "A utilitarian approach provides a systematic way to model respondents’ behavior under the assumption that they maximize their expected utilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In  a utilitarian analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A truth border divides the space of conditional probabilities of being perceived as belonging to the sensitive group, $ \\text{Pr}(A|\\text{yes}) $ and $ \\text{Pr}(A|\\text{no}) $, into the truth-telling region and the lying region.  \n",
    "- The optimal model design is obtained at the point where the truth border touches the lowest possible iso-variance curve.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A practical implication of the  analysis of [[Lju93](https://python.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#id8)] is that uncertainty about respondents’ demands for privacy can be acknowledged by **choosing $ \\text{Pr}(A|\\text{yes}) $ and $ \\text{Pr}(A|\\text{no}) $ sufficiently close to each other**."
