    "  - all other active  prospective buyers must submit a new bid on some house  \n",
    "  - new bids on a house must be at least equal to the prevailing temporary price that won the last round **plus** $ \\epsilon $  \n",
    "  - if a person does not submit a new bid and was also not a temporary winner from the previous round, that  person must  drop out of the auction permanently  \n",
    "  - for each house, the highest bid, whether it is a new bid or was the temporary winner from the previous round, is announced, with the person who made that new (temporarily) winning bid being (temporarily) awarded the house to start the next round  \n",

The  argmax function in Python always returns the first argmax element. We instead  prefer to randomize among such winner. For that reason,  we write our own argmax function below.\n",

    "(2) **Seller’s choice of winner if same price bid cast by several buyers.** To resolve  this ambiguity, we use the np.random.choice function below.\n",
